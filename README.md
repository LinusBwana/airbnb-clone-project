## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Our comprehensive user management system handles user registration, authentication, and profile management for both guests and property hosts. Users can securely create accounts, manage their personal information, and maintain separate profiles for booking properties or listing their own accommodations. This foundational feature ensures a personalized experience while maintaining robust security standards for all platform interactions.

### Property Management
The property management feature enables hosts to create detailed property listings with comprehensive information including descriptions, pricing, amenities, and multiple high-quality images. Property owners can easily update availability, modify pricing dynamically, and manage property-specific settings to attract potential guests. This system serves as the core marketplace functionality that connects property owners with travelers seeking accommodations.

### Booking System
Our sophisticated booking system facilitates seamless reservation management from initial property search through check-out completion. Users can search available properties by location and dates, make instant or request-based bookings, and track their reservation status in real-time. The system handles complex booking logic including availability checking, date validation, and automated confirmation processes to ensure smooth transactions for both guests and hosts.

### Payment Processing
The integrated payment processing system securely handles all financial transactions including booking payments, security deposits, and refund processing. Built with industry-standard security protocols, it supports multiple payment methods and provides transparent transaction tracking for both guests and hosts. This feature ensures trust and reliability in the platform's financial operations while maintaining PCI compliance standards.

### Review System
The review and rating system enables guests to share authentic feedback about their booking experiences while helping future travelers make informed decisions. Only verified bookings can generate reviews, ensuring authenticity and preventing fake feedback. This feature builds community trust, helps hosts improve their offerings, and provides valuable social proof that drives platform credibility and user engagement.

### Real-time Communication
Our messaging system facilitates direct communication between guests and hosts throughout the booking process and stay duration. Users can ask questions about properties, coordinate check-in details, and resolve any issues that arise during their stay. This feature enhances customer service, reduces booking uncertainty, and creates a more connected community experience on the platform.

## API Security

### Authentication & Authorization
The platform implements Django REST Framework's BasicAuthentication combined with role-based access control to ensure users can only access and modify data they are authorized to handle. BasicAuthentication provides secure username/password verification for API access, with session management handled by Django's built-in authentication system. This is crucial for protecting user accounts from unauthorized access and ensuring that hosts can only manage their own properties while guests can only access their own booking information.

### Data Protection & Encryption
All sensitive data including passwords, payment information, and personal details are encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. API communications are secured through HTTPS/TLS protocols, and database connections use encrypted channels. This comprehensive approach is essential for maintaining user trust, complying with data protection regulations like GDPR, and preventing data breaches that could compromise user privacy and financial information.

### Rate Limiting & API Security
Advanced rate limiting mechanisms prevent API abuse, DDoS attacks, and automated scraping attempts while ensuring legitimate users maintain smooth platform access. IP-based and user-based throttling, along with request validation and sanitization, protect against malicious activities. These measures are critical for maintaining platform stability, preventing resource exhaustion, and protecting against fraudulent booking attempts or payment system exploitation.

### Payment Security
Payment processing implements PCI DSS compliance standards with tokenization of sensitive card data and secure integration with trusted payment gateways. All financial transactions are logged and monitored for suspicious activity with real-time fraud detection mechanisms. This level of security is paramount for protecting users' financial information, maintaining merchant account compliance, and building the trust necessary for users to confidently make high-value accommodation bookings.

### Input Validation & Injection Prevention
Comprehensive input validation and sanitization prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other common web vulnerabilities through parameterized queries and strict data type validation. All user inputs are validated both client-side and server-side with additional business logic validation. This protection is essential for preventing malicious users from compromising the database
