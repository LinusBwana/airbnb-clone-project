# airbnb-clone-project

## Project Overview - airbnb-clone-project
This project is the backend implementation of an Airbnb Clone, built to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. It provides a scalable and efficient foundation for handling user authentication, property listings, bookings, and payment processing. Designed with clean architecture and RESTful principles, this backend ensures a smooth and reliable experience for both guests and hosts.

## Project Goals
1. **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
2. **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.  
3. **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.  
4. **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.  
5. **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.  

## Technology Stack
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
